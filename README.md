# MazeSolver
A solver for mazes

## Build

### CMAKE
To build, simply run:
```
mkdir build
mkdir lib
mkdir bin
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```
The compiled program will be found in **bin**.

## Solving a maze
The main purpose of this project is to solve mazes. However, it does have
the ability to generate a maze for demonstration purposes.

### Generate a maze and solve
Simply running `MazeSolver` will generate a 10x10 maze and display the solution.

Running `MazeSolver <W> <H>` will generate a maze of size WxH and display
the solution.

### Providing a maze to solve
To provide a maze to solve, use the **-i** flag like so `MazeSolver -i <file>`.

### Solution example
Take the following maze:
```
#####################
#        X  # #   # #
### ##### # # # ### #
# # #     #       # #
# # ### # ### ##### #
# # # # # #     # # #
# ### # ##### # # # #
#     #   # # # #   #
# ### # # # # # # # #
# #   # # #   #   # #
# # # # # ######### #
# # #   #     #     #
# ##### ### ### #####
# # # # # # #       #
### # ### ### ### ###
#   #           # # #
# ######### # ### # #
#       # # # #     #
# ### # # ### ##### #
# #   #       #    S#
#####################
```
This is a solution generated by the solver:
```
#####################
#        x**#.#   #.#
### ##### #*#.# ###.#
# # #     #***    #.#
# # ### # ###*#####.#
# # # # # #  ***#.#.#
# ### # ##### #*#.#.#
#     #   # # #*#***#
# ### # # # # #*#*#*#
# #   # # #   #***#*#
# # # # # #########*#
# # #   #     #*****#
# ##### ### ###*#####
# # # # # # #  ***  #
### # ### ### ###*###
#   #           #*#.#
# ######### # ###*#.#
#       # # # #  ***#
# ### # # ### #####*#
# #   #       #    s#
#####################
```

### Symbol Definition
The following symbols are defined for a maze:
* \#    - Wall
* space - Path (not visited or solution)
* .     - Path (visited, but not solution)
* \*    - Path (solution)
* S     - Starting location (not visited)
* s     - Starting location (visited)
* X     - Destination (not visited)
* x     - Destination (visited)

### Format
A valid maze must have:
1. A border of walls.
2. A start labeled `S`.
3. An end labeled `X`.

The maze consist of cells. Each cell is defined as a 9x9 grid of text.

This is an example of a cell:
```
###
# #
###
```
Only the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) are considered
for walls. The corners are included mainly for alignment and ascetics.

This is an example of a cell with no walls:
```
# #
   
# #
```

Two neighboring cells will share the same wall.

This is an example of two neighboring cells (1 and 2):
```
#####
#1 2#
#####
```

This is an example of four cells in a 2x2 formation:
```
#####
#1 2#
### #
#3 4#
#####
```
Notice that for a maze of size MxN, it takes $(2M+1)\times(2N+1)$ characters
to store the maze.
